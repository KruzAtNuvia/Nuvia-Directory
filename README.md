# Nuvia-Directory
Centralized Website for Nuvia Dental Lab that was built in Zoho Creator. Removed all company links to keep company information private.

This website is a very fun project that I have enjoyed working on. It pushed my boundaries on knowledge, and forced me to experiment with different techniques to get everything that I was looking to add. This website used Functions to call larger code snippets into the code to keep it cleaner. I also created a Location Verification program that would check who was logging in based on their IP addresses. There was also multiple different announcement sections and banners that allowed for the administration team to announce important things. I also used Zoho Creator and Deluge to create different permissions and restrict access to some things in the website based off those permissions.
