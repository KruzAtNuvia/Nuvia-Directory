# Nuvia-Directory
A Centralized Website for Nuvia Dental Lab, built in Zoho Creator

This project has been such a fun and rewarding experience for me. Even though I’m not officially on the DEV team, I wanted to challenge myself and see just how far I could push my understanding of web development. Throughout this process, I’ve had to step outside my comfort zone, experiment with different techniques, and problem-solve in ways I hadn’t before.

One of the biggest things I focused on was keeping the code clean and organized. I used Functions to call larger code snippets, which helped maintain structure and readability. I also developed a Location Verification program that checks who’s logging in based on IP addresses, adding an extra layer of security.

Beyond that, I built multiple announcement sections and banners, allowing the administration team to post important updates seamlessly. I also used Zoho Creator and Deluge to set up different permission levels, restricting access to certain parts of the site based on user roles. This made sure that sensitive information stayed protected while still giving the right people the access they needed.

If you see <%= %> in the code, that’s Deluge logic—used alongside HTML and CSS to handle permission settings, insert code snippets, and automate various site functions.

Overall, this project has been a huge learning experience, and I’ve loved every part of it. There’s something really rewarding about building something from the ground up, especially when it pushes your skills to the next level.
